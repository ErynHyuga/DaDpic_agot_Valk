#Late Medieval

This period set the stage for the transformations in art, literature, and social etiquette that would characterize the subsequent centuries."

innovation_military_04:0 "Conscription"
innovation_military_04_desc:0 "The Late Medieval period witnessed significant changes in military organization and leadership. As warfare evolved and became more complex, the reliance on professional standing armies increased.

This marked a departure from the earlier system of personal loyalty and heraldic banners. The emergence of gunpowder and artillery further transformed military strategies, requiring more disciplined and organized armies. The shift toward conscription laid the groundwork for the military structures of the early modern period."

innovation_tactics_04:0 "Mercenary Bands"
