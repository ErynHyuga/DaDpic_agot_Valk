#### This scripted trigger has been modified to allow matriarchs to grant landed titles to female dynasty members and some adjustments have been made for cultural traditions
### Note that this is supposed to generate nice tooltips, but my experience is that it does not, not even with all mods disabled. Weird.
### Given that I'm not going to worry about the fact that my tooltips don't generate very nicely. Niether custom_descritpion nor custom_tooltip seem to help here.
