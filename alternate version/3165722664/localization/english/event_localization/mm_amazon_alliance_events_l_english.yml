	mz_amazon_alliance.2001.desc:0 "Discussing [mz_amazon_warrior.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] origin with the warrior in question has enlightened me to the current stat of the Amazons. [mz_amazon_warrior.GetHerHim|U] people did at one point dwell in the regions surrounding the Pontic mountains, though legends say in ancient times they made Greece itself their home. In the ages since they have scattered to the four winds, with some making their home across the Black Sea and others scattering throughout all the known world.\n\nThough they are not a people united under any single ruler or cause, Amazons may be found just about anywhere, hidden on the fringes of civilization, in various pockets of wilderness. [mz_amazon_warrior.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] further elaborates that, if I would like, [mz_amazon_warrior.GetSheHe] is willing to put me in contact with a nearby Amazonian enclave, allowing the [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetBaseNameNoTooltip] dynasty to recruit more of [mz_amazon_warrior.GetHerHis] people to serve as warriors or hunters."

The diaspora is willing to provide training to women in dynastic courts, and have expressed interest in furthering our relations, should we continue to recruit Amazons and allow them to serve us honorably."

	mz_amazon_alliance.2301.desc:0 "The time has come to begin integrating the Amazons into those lands ruled by the [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetBaseNameNoTooltip] dynasty, and it would seem the Amazons themselves agree. More and more of the diaspora arrive to settle within our lands every year, and we must look to a future of cooperation together. It falls upon me to decide just what form that future that may take.

Though they possess no central leadership to appeal to, it's hard to overstate just how much both parties have benefited from our continued cooperation. Under our leadership, the formerly wandering warriors now have lands to truly call their own, and as such, they are willing to heed the call of any woman of the [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetBaseNameNoTooltip] dynasty and provide what aid they can."

	mz_amazon_alliance.3001.desc:0 "The time has come to rally the Amazons to my side and set out on a grand campaign to claim a homeland for them! Should I be successful, I will have earned the respect and adoration of a loyal and skilled band of warrior women, and have the opportunity to build a true matriarchal realm. The coming months should be spent making ready; there is no need to rush into things. Additional troops should be recruited, and I have word that more Amazons will be arriving shortly to bolster my ranks. I have five years, plenty of time to prepare... and pick a target.\n\n#help You will gain a special [casus_belli|E] to use to conquer a homeland for the Amazons. Use the casus belli within five years, or you will lose significant favor with the Amazons. Upon declaring war using the casus belli, you will receive a number of special troops, increasing with the amount of Amazon warriors in your court. It is therefore worth considering not usuing the casus belli right away, and instead wait a few months for additional warriors to arrive, and make use of the discount to recruit additional [men_at_arms|E].#!"
