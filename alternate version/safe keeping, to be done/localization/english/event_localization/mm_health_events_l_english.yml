  mz_health.2001.desc:0 "[physician.GetTitledFirstName] has informed me that lover's pox is notoriously difficult to treat. Though [physician.GetSheHe] can try conventional treatments, they are unlikely to produce anything other than temporary relief, and even the odds of that are not especially high. [physician.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] offers an alternative--there are certain salves and herbs that can be applied topically to the area which have a better chance of success, and in some cases can even result in a nigh-miraculous cure. They are quite expensive, however, and will need to be acquired from special vendors."
