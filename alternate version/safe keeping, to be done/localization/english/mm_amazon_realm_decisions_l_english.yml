	mz_amazon_cb_adventure_decision_desc:0 "For centuries, the Amazons have remained hidden, scattered to the winds. While many in the diaspora are resigned to this, there are those who long to unite and build a new Amazonian realm. What is needed is a mighty ruler to conquer the lost homeland of the Amazons, and grant them leave to settle.\n\nI could be this ruler, but I must choose: shall I conquer for them their ancestral lands in Greece and Anatolia, or shall we follow the Amazon migration north, across the Baltic sea, and reclaim the steppe for Scythia, as the Amazons did in ages past? Whatever I choose, the Amazons are willing to raise a mighty army for this endeavour, should I but prove myself."
